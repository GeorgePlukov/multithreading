# Multithreading
This repository is composed of 6 projects created for CS 4F03 at McMaster University.It is a beginning to learning multithreaded programming using C/C++ with a variety of different tools.


#PA1 and PA2
The goal of this assignment is to generate a string of random characters. Command line arguments are given determining the alphabet, size of string, and a property that the string tries to verify.

An example of a use of this program is shown here:

` /pal.x i N L M c0 c1 c2`

Where:

i: index of the property Fi which each segment of S needs to satisfy
N: number of threads
L: length of each S
M: number of segments in S
c0,c1,c2: letters to be used in property check
